# FetchMobileTakeHomeProject_ConnorOtt
iOS recipe app created for Fetch's iOS apprenticeship take home test

### Summary: The screenshots below highlight the two main features of my app - the recipe list and detailed recipe view. The recipe list is a list of all the recipes fetched by the API call and includes the name and small image of each recipe. Clicking the refresh button will regenerate the list of recipes. Clicking on any specific recipe will open a detailed page for that recipe, which will show the recipe's large image and include links to the recipes website and youtube video.

### Focus Areas: I chose to focus on the architecture the most when creating this application. I chose to do this because by creating a solid MVVM architecture for this app I felt that the other areas of the app would be much easier to develop, and easier to scale in the future. 

### Time Spent: I spent approximately 5 hours working on this project. I allocated my time by spending about 1 hour on architecture and design, 2 hours on implementing the API calls and concurrency, 1 hour on UI/UX implementation, and 1 hour on testing.

### Trade-offs and Decisions: One significant trade-off I made in my approach when developing the app was to prioritize the other parts of the app rather than the UI. By focusing on the architecture and backend rather than the UI, I ensured that my recipe app has a solid foundation and is easy to iterate and improve upon in the future. 

### Weakest Part of the Project: I think the weakest part of my project is the UI. My UI is simple but effective, it could definitely be enhanced further to look more appealing for the user.
